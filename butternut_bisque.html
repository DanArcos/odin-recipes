        <li>1 ½ cups chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>

        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>French Onion Toast Toppers:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>3 large sweet onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 large shallot, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sherry</li>
        <li>½ cup low-sodium beef broth</li>
        <li>2 fresh thyme sprigs</li>
        <li>6 slices sourdough bread</li>
        <li>6 teaspoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>6 ounces shredded Gruyere cheese</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Add onion and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. 
            Cook, stirring frequently, until onion is tender but not browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to medium-high. Stir in tomato paste. Cook, stirring frequently, until mixture 
            begins to caramelize and brown, about 2 minutes. Add squash, chicken broth, remaining kosher 
            salt, and cayenne pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until squash is very tender, 
            20 to 25 minutes. Reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>Using an immersion blender, blend squash mixture until smooth. (Or transfer mixture, 
            in batches if needed, to a blender or food processor. Cover and blend or process until 
            smooth. Return to pot.) Stir in cream and maple syrup.</li>
        <li>Ladle soup into wide shallow bowls. Serve with French Onion Toast Toppers and top with 
            parsley.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>French Onion Toast Toppers:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat butter and olive oil in a very large skillet over medium-low heat until butter 
            is melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Add sweet onions, shallot, salt, and pepper. Cook, covered, 
            stirring occasionally, until onions are tender, 12 to 14 minutes. Increase heat to 
            medium-high. Cook, uncovered, stirring frequently, until onions are golden brown, 
            3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium. Stir in sherry and cook 2 minutes more. Add low-sodium beef 
            stock and fresh thyme sprigs. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until liquid 
            is reduced and onions are very tender, about 5 minutes. Remove thyme and discard.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, arrange sourdough bread slices on a large baking sheet. Spread each slice 
            with 1 teaspoon softened butter. Bake, turning once halfway through, until light brown, 
            8 to 10 minutes. Preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Top bread slices with caramelized onion mixture and shredded Gruyère cheese. Broil 
            until cheese is melted, about 2 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
